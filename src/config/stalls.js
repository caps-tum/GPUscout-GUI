        help_text: `The warp was stalled waiting for an immediate constant cache (IMC) miss, which means that data requested from constant memory was not yet available in the IMC and had to be requested from the slower device memory instead.
Because accesses to different addresses from threads within the same warp are serialized, cost scales linearly with the number of unuique addresses read by all threads within a warp. This makes using constant cache most effective in situations where threads in the same warp access only few distinct locations. If all threads of a warp access the same location, then constant memory can be as fast as a register access.
In the SASS code, immediate constants are encoded as c[bank][offset]. To reduce the number of IMC misses, review the use of constant memory in the SASS code at the locations of these stalls.`,

        help_text: `The warp was stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a previous L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation (in contrast to MIO operations in short scoreboard stalls). Scoreboarding manages dependencies, ensuring that instructions are not issued until the data they need is ready. Operations involving memory loads can often take multiple cycles to complete, so later instructions depending on the loaded data can only be issued when the data is available.
In the SASS code, look for the instruction producing the data being waited on. Generally, to reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses, verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Moving frequently used data to shared memory can also help.`,

Scoreboarding manages dependencies, ensuring that instructions are not issued until the data they need is ready. Operations involving memory input and/or output can often take multiple cycles to complete, so later instructions depending on resulting data can only be issued when they have completed. The primary reason for a high number of short scoreboard stalls are typically memory operations to shared memory. Other reasons include frequent execution of special math instructions or dynamic branching (e.g. BRX, JMX).
To reduce the number of short scoreboaed stalls, check if there are shared memory operations and reduce bank conflicts, if found. Assigning frequently accessed values to variables can assist the compiler in using low-latency registers instead of direct memory accesses.`,

This situation typically arises when there are dependencies between instructions, and the warp scheduler has no other work (instructions or warps) available to hide the latency.
A high number of these stalls is no uncommon in very short kernels with less than one full wave of work in the grid.
To reduce the number of no instruction stalls, avoid excessively jumping across large blocks of assembly code, as this could lead to misses in the instruction cache.`,

To avoid wait stalls, try increasing the number of active warps, restructuring the code, or unrolling loops with the goal of hiding instruction latencies. Switching to lower latency instructions (e.g. using fast math compiler options) should also be considered.`,

To avoid LG throttle stalls, avoid redundant global memory accesses. Also try to avoid using thread-local memory by checking if dynamically indexed arrays are declared in local scope, of if the kernel has excessive register pressure causing by spills. If applicable, consider combining multiple lower-width memory operations into fewer wider memory operations and try interleaving memory operations and math instructions.`,

High numbers of these stalls indicate there are a sufficient nmber of warps to cover warp latencies and the number of active warps could be reduced to possibly increase cache coherence and adta locality.`,
